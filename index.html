      <p class="lead">Dear Kualo Team,</p>
      <p>September, 2020</p>
    </div>
    <div class="body">
      <p>
        I am writing to you regarding the <strong>Web Hosting Superstar</strong> position in Latin America. I learned
        about this position
        directly from your site, and I learned about Kualo from a WordPress charity site that I am doing some volunteer
        work on. I currently work as an Account Manager for a small web design company in Santiago, Chile, and the Web
        Hosting Superstar position stood out for its commitment to customer satisfaction, continuous learning, quality
        service,
        and
        environmental and social responsibility.
        <br><br>
        The job posting on your site had some honest, straightforward language, so I‚Äôll do the same and ‚Äúkeep it real‚Äù.
        What jumps out about Kualo is its focus on culture and a desire to be flexible, question things, collaborate,
        and wear many hats, all while delivering a great service. I saw your job posting and thought to myself ‚ÄúI
        basically do a version of that‚Äù, that is, I monitor helpdesk, answer tough questions, get on calls with unhappy
        clients, rapidly learn then explain new and difficult concepts (thanks, Google), try to put out multiple fires
        in a day, and of course play(ed) ping pong with the sales team.
        <br><br>
        Simply put, I‚Äôd love the opportunity to continue developing and learning new skills with Kualo. <strong>What
          does Kualo get with me?</strong> A quick learner, curious mind, and a slightly goofy hard worker who takes
        ownership of his
        failures and undestands that success is a team effort. I do a lot of things well, but I‚Äôll be honest, there‚Äôs a
        lot to learn, and I‚Äôm excited at the prospect of bringing that curiosity to Kualo to help deliver a great
        customer
        experience. It‚Äôs a win-win!
        <br><br>
        Please <a class="resume-link" target="_blank" rel="none"
          href="https://www.notion.so/Phil-s-Resume-8802ec4d3b064a5f8c268acc201eabf7">take a
          look at my
          resume</a>, and I am more than happy to answer any questions you have
        about what I do, where I‚Äôve been, and of course, my biggest weakness. I was struck immediately by
        Kualo‚Äôs ideals and commitment to excellence, and I hope you‚Äôve felt the same. I look forward to hearing from you
        to continue the application process.
